# MediPredict — AI Chatbot Model (ai-model/)

A lightweight, CPU-only medical Q&A chatbot. Uses TF-IDF + cosine similarity
(scikit-learn) to retrieve the closest matching question from a medical
dataset and return its answer. No GPU, no deep learning framework needed.

## 1. Get a free dataset

Pick one (both are free and don't need special permission for student/academic use):

- **MedQuAD** (recommended — NIH-sourced, ~47k medical Q&A pairs):
  https://github.com/abachaa/MedQuAD
  It comes as a set of XML files split by source; there are also cleaned
  CSV mirrors linked from that repo and on Kaggle — search
  "MedQuAD csv kaggle" and download the version with `question` and
  `answer` columns.

- **AI Medical Chatbot dataset** (Hugging Face, simpler flat CSV):
  https://huggingface.co/datasets/ruslanmv/ai-medical-chatbot

The project uses the combined dataset saved as `ai_model/data/medquad_combined.csv`. This dataset combines the original MedQuAD questions with the enhanced dataset while removing duplicate questions. Keep the original CSV files for reference. The training script expects columns containing question and answer text.

## 2. Install dependencies (no GPU needed)

```bash
cd ai_model
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Train the model

```bash
python train_model.py --data data/medquad_combined.csv --out model
```

This creates a `model/` folder with the saved TF-IDF vectorizer and the
Q&A lookup table. Training takes seconds to a couple of minutes on a CPU,
even for tens of thousands of rows.

## 4. Run the chatbot service

```bash
python app.py
```

Starts on `http://localhost:8000`. Test it:

```bash
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/predict" -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"message":"what are the symptoms of diabetes"}'
```

## 5. Connect it to your Node backend

Replace `backend/src/services/aiService.js` with the updated version
(see chat instructions) and add this line to `backend/.env`:

```env
LOCAL_MODEL_URL=http://localhost:8000/predict
```

With both the Python service (port 8000) and the Node backend (port 4000)
running, your existing `AIChatbot.jsx` frontend needs **no changes** — it
already calls `/api/chat`, which will now try your trained model first.
